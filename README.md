I programmed the ARIMA model to forecast number of receipts. 
Based on the Time Series Analysis, I used Auto Regressive and Moving Average methods to learn the trend of the data.
I used ACF and PACF to choose the most optimized parameter for the model to train.
I didn't use any advanced library but only use linear regression to build the model.
I also used Flask to build a light weight web application. It contains data visualizaition, and you can interact with the page.
